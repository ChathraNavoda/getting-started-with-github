Welcome to "Getting started with GitHub"! :wave:

**What is an issue?**

[Issues on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) is a means to track ideas, log bugs, or track tasks with a measurable outcome. Especially when working with a collaborator, or team, it is a critical part of working together. Before you start working on a task, you should create an issue. The issue is a means to communicate the problem or feature to others and a high-level overview of the tasks needed to complete the work.

Be careful not to get stuck on this step, as you can continually expand and clarify the details as you know more. A helpful list to add to an issue is an [acceptance criteria](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/acceptance-criteria-purposes-formats-and-best-practices/) list.

Let us look at an example.

For this course, the first step is to create an issue. Follow the steps below:

1. At the top of the page, right-click on the "Issues" tab and open it in a new browser tab.
  
![Shows the GitHub header with the second tab titled, "Issues", highlighted.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10350960/194723854-e0311074-95d1-40b0-aca7-bf3f2c2ad73c.png)
  
2. Click on the "New issue" button.
  
![Shows three buttons the last of which is titled, "New issue"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10350960/194723933-0bb1f870-d42b-4250-b099-78d771d10b06.png)

3. The following screen shows an form where you will enter the issue details.
  
![Shows a form that contains two input form fields. One is for the title, the second for the issuee details.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10350960/194723977-3c4ceadf-b65b-4b91-b561-b33be61883ab.png)
  
3. Add the following issue title: "chore: create contribution document".
4. In the description of the issue, add the following:

```markdown
Add a contribution document to the repository.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Create a new file called CONTRIBUTING.md in the project's root.
- [ ] Add a description of the steps to follow when contributing.
- [ ] Commit changes and open a pull request.
```
  
![Shows the form from before but with the details from above filled in.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10350960/194724509-a85db5b2-7d42-4e53-b22c-9521937664ef.png)

5. Click the "Submit new issue" button.
  
![Shows a green button with the label, "Submit new issue"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10350960/194724032-d2c905b2-be13-45bd-a9ef-6b417a75141a.png)
  
### New issue overview
  
![Shows the newly submitted issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10350960/194724802-89cd7a2e-44e6-4840-9751-a70312cb0632.png)

Once you have created the issue there are a couple of things of note. The first is in the header section of the issue. Other than the title you will notice a, what is sometimes called a pill, with the words, "3 tasks".
  
![Shows the header of the issue with a section indicating that the issue has three tasks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10350960/194725307-aaaa532f-20af-45f5-b05a-bf8faf16b97e.png)
  
You will also notice that in the descrription of the issue under the acceptance criteria heading, is our three tasks with checkboxes next to them.
  
![Shows the acceptance criteria section with three items, each with a checkbox next to it.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10350960/194725480-5345b2ef-1ab9-4740-83c9-32b07a941cc0.png)
  
These are the three tasks that is referenced in the "pill" shown earlier. Nice, right?! We will come back to this later so, do not close the tab with the issue just yet. Once you have completed the steps, refresh this page and continue with the second step.

> **NOTE:** If the next step is not shown as expanded, please double check that you followed the steps correctly. It is important to use the exact same title and contents for the issue you create.
